makehelp is a small perl script which provides built-in doxygen-style help in Makefiles.
Special comments in the makefile are used to provide user documentation for goals and variables.
These comments are extracted by makehelp to print a nice documentation.
That documentation is similar to the built-in help texts of UNIX commands.

Makehelp comments start with ## instead of #.
They should be positioned before variables or goals.
Included makefiles are supported.

For an example, see directory example.
